txtls
=====

A prototype TLS endpoint that uses PEP 543 to work across a number of TLS
backends.

Right now this is an extremely early prototype and should not be used in
production code: it's intended mostly to validate our assumptions about how the
code works. Eventually this should transition to a productionized Twisted
endpoint, but until that time this should be considered mostly an interesting
oddity.
